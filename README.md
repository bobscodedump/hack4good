Our motivation
With a mission to uplift the emotional well-being of kidney patients, our project aims to empower patients with kidney failure by connecting with job opportunities. We believe that employment plays a crucial role in increasing their sense of self-worth and independence. Our goal is to integrate kidney patients into the workforce and challenge society's perception of them, so that employers can uncover their hidden talents.

To achieve this, we offer a user-friendly platform for employers to find talented individuals. Job seekers can easily upload their resumes and explore various online courses aimed at improving their employability, with a focus on tasks that can be performed remotely, such as call center services, web design, and more. Our website also features stories of kidney patients for employers to understand the unique circumstances faced by kidney patients, such as juggling with their dialysis schedule as well as managing the physical demands of kidney dialysis.
